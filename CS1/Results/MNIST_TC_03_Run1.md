# Paper-Code Consistency Analysis

**Paper:** DeepCNN_JournalArticle
**Code:** MNIST_TC_03
**Analysis Date:** 2025-05-07

## Analysis Results

There are several discrepancies between the research paper and the code implementation that could affect reproducibility and validity of the results:

1. **Batch Size Discrepancy**
   - Paper (Section II.C): "Each fold iteration trains for 10 epochs with a batch size of 32"
   - Code: `model.fit(trainX, trainY, epochs=10, batch_size=len(trainX), validation_data=(testX, testY), verbose=0)`
   - Impact: The code uses the entire training set as a single batch (batch_size=len(trainX)), which is effectively batch gradient descent rather than mini-batch (32) as claimed in the paper. This would significantly alter the optimization dynamics, convergence behavior, and potentially the final results.

2. **Model Architecture Visualization Mismatch**
   - Paper (Fig. 1): Shows a specific architecture with labeled dimensions for each layer
   - Code: Implements a similar but not identical architecture (especially regarding the number of convolutional layers and their arrangement)
   - Impact: The architectural differences could lead to different feature learning capabilities and performance results.

3. **Cross-Validation Implementation**
   - Paper (Section II.C): Describes using the original 60,000 MNIST training examples divided into five equal folds
   - Code: Uses KFold from sklearn on the entire dataset without explicit separation of the standard MNIST test set
   - Impact: This creates a methodological difference in how model performance is evaluated compared to what's described in the paper.

4. **Performance Metrics Reporting**
   - Paper (Table 1): Reports specific validation accuracies for each fold (e.g., 99.017%, 98.975%, etc.)
   - Code: Prints accuracy but doesn't specifically record or display it in the same format as the paper
   - Impact: Makes direct comparison between the paper's reported results and code output difficult.

5. **Training Process**
   - Paper (Section II.C): Mentions training on 48,000 examples while validating on 12,000 examples
   - Code: The split depends on KFold implementation but doesn't explicitly ensure this 48,000/12,000 division
   - Impact: Different training/validation splits could affect model performance and reproducibility.

These discrepancies, particularly the batch size difference, would make it difficult to reproduce the exact results claimed in the paper using the provided code implementation.
