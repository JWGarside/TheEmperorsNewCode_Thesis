## Analysis Results

# DISCREPANCIES FOUND

After analyzing both the research paper and the provided code implementation, I've identified several discrepancies that could affect reproducibility or validity of the results:

## 1. Model Architecture Discrepancy

**Paper**: In Figure 1 and Section II.B, the paper describes a CNN architecture with three convolutional blocks (C1, C2, C3) with filter counts of 32, 64, and 64 respectively, and specifically mentions "two consecutive convolutional layers" in the second block.

**Code**: The implementation in `define_model()` has only two convolutional blocks with the second block having two consecutive Conv2D layers.

```python
model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', kernel_initializer='he_uniform', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)))
model.add(MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', kernel_initializer='he_uniform'))
model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', kernel_initializer='he_uniform'))
model.add(MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
```

**Impact**: This architectural difference could significantly affect the model's capacity and performance. The paper reports 99.012% accuracy, but the implemented model might achieve different results due to having fewer convolutional layers than described.

## 2. Cross-Validation Implementation

**Paper**: Section II.C describes a comprehensive 5-fold cross-validation strategy where "the original 60,000 MNIST training examples [are divided] into five equal folds."

**Code**: The implementation uses `KFold` from scikit-learn, but applies it to the entire dataset without separating the standard MNIST test set:

```python
kfold = KFold(n_folds, shuffle=True, random_state=1)
for train_ix, test_ix in kfold.split(dataX):
    # select rows for train and test
    trainX, trainY, testX, testY = dataX[train_ix], dataY[train_ix], dataX[test_ix], dataY[test_ix]
```

**Impact**: The paper methodology specifically mentions using only the training set for cross-validation, while the code appears to use the entire dataset. This would lead to different data splits than described in the paper, potentially affecting the reported performance metrics.

## 3. Validation Accuracy Reporting

**Paper**: Table 1 reports specific validation accuracies for each fold (99.017%, 98.975%, 99.017%, 99.058%, 98.992%) with a mean of 99.012%.

**Code**: The code prints individual fold accuracies and calculates mean and standard deviation, but doesn't store the specific per-fold results in a way that would produce the exact table shown in the paper:

```python
print('> %.3f' % (acc * 100.0))
# stores scores
scores.append(acc)
```

**Impact**: While this doesn't necessarily affect reproducibility, it makes it difficult to verify if the exact results reported in the paper can be obtained from the provided implementation.

## 4. Optimizer Configuration

**Paper**: Section II.C mentions "learning rate to 0.01" for the SGD optimizer.

**Code**: The implementation uses:
```python
opt = SGD(learning_rate=0.01, momentum=0.9)
```

**Impact**: The code correctly implements the learning rate as described, but the paper doesn't explicitly mention the momentum value of 0.9 in the main text (though it does mention "momentum (0.9)" in Section II.C). This could affect reproducibility if someone implemented the model based solely on the main methodology description without noticing this detail.

## Summary

The most significant discrepancy is the model architecture difference, which could substantially impact the model's performance. The cross-validation implementation also differs from what's described in the paper. These discrepancies would likely lead to different results than those reported in the paper, affecting both reproducibility and potentially the validity of the comparative findings.
