# Paper-Code Consistency Analysis

**Paper:** DeepCNN_JournalArticle
**Code:** MNIST_MA_01
**Analysis Date:** 2025-05-07

## Analysis Results

I've analyzed both the research paper "Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Handwritten Digit Recognition: A Cross-Validated Approach on the MNIST Dataset" and the provided Python code implementation. Here are my findings regarding discrepancies that could affect reproducibility:

## DISCREPANCIES FOUND

### 1. Filter Sizes in First Convolutional Layer
- **Paper description**: Section II.B describes the initial convolutional layer as having "32 filters of size 3×3"
- **Code implementation**: Line 42 shows `model.add(Conv2D(64, (5, 5), activation='relu', kernel_initializer='he_uniform', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)))`
- **Impact**: The code uses 64 filters of size 5×5 instead of 32 filters of size 3×3, which significantly changes the network capacity and receptive field in the first layer. This would likely affect both performance metrics and training dynamics.

### 2. Network Architecture Depth
- **Paper description**: Figure 1 and Section II.B describe a network with two convolutional blocks, where the second block has "two consecutive convolutional layers, each utilizing 64 filters of size 3×3"
- **Code implementation**: Lines 42-46 show three convolutional layers total with all having 64 filters
- **Impact**: The different architecture would lead to different feature hierarchies and potentially different classification performance.

### 3. Cross-Validation Implementation
- **Paper description**: Section II.C states "we implement a comprehensive k-fold cross-validation strategy with k=5" and "For each of the five experimental iterations, we train on 48,000 examples (four folds) while validating on the remaining 12,000 examples (one fold)"
- **Code implementation**: Lines 56-68 implement cross-validation but use the entire training set (60,000 examples) rather than explicitly creating 5 equal folds of 12,000 examples each
- **Impact**: While the code does use 5-fold cross-validation, the precise data partitioning may differ from what's described in the paper, potentially affecting the reported accuracy statistics.

### 4. Learning Rate
- **Paper description**: Section II.C mentions "We set the learning rate to 0.01"
- **Code implementation**: Line 49 shows `opt = SGD(learning_rate=0.01, momentum=0.9)`
- **Impact**: No discrepancy here - this is correctly implemented.

### 5. Performance Metrics
- **Paper description**: Table 1 reports a mean validation accuracy of 99.012% with a standard deviation of 0.028%
- **Code implementation**: The code calculates and reports these metrics but the actual values would likely differ due to the architectural differences
- **Impact**: The performance metrics reported in the paper would not be reproducible with the provided code due to the architectural differences.

### 6. Figure Representation
- **Paper description**: Figure 2 shows training and validation loss/accuracy curves with specific patterns
- **Code implementation**: The plotting function in lines 70-81 would produce similar visualizations but with different patterns due to the architectural differences
- **Impact**: The visualization patterns would differ from those presented in the paper.

These discrepancies, particularly in the network architecture, would make it difficult to reproduce the exact results reported in the paper using the provided code implementation.
