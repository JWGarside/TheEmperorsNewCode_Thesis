# Paper-Code Consistency Analysis

**Paper:** DeepCNN_JournalArticle
**Code:** MNIST_DP_03
**Analysis Date:** 2025-05-07

## Analysis Results

After analyzing both the research paper and the code implementation, I've identified several discrepancies that could affect reproducibility or validity of the work:

1. **Input Shape Discrepancy**
   - Paper: In section II.A, the paper describes reshaping images to (28, 28, 1) to "explicitly include a single channel dimension"
   - Code: In the `load_dataset()` function, images are reshaped to (1, 28, 28)
   - Impact: This channel ordering difference (channels-last vs. channels-first format) would cause shape incompatibility errors when running the model as defined in the paper

2. **Model Architecture Visualization vs. Implementation**
   - Paper: Figure 1 shows a specific CNN architecture with labeled dimensions for each layer
   - Code: The implementation in `define_model()` doesn't fully match the diagram - particularly the progression of filter counts (32→64→64→64) shown in the figure
   - Impact: The actual implemented architecture might perform differently than what's visually represented in the paper

3. **Optimizer Learning Rate**
   - Paper: Section II.C mentions "We set the learning rate to 0.01"
   - Code: Uses `learning_rate=0.01` which matches the paper, but this parameter name suggests the code was written for newer TensorFlow versions, while the paper might have been tested with an older version where the parameter was named differently
   - Impact: Version inconsistencies could lead to subtle implementation differences

4. **Cross-Validation Implementation**
   - Paper: Section II.C describes dividing "the original 60,000 MNIST training examples into five equal folds"
   - Code: The `evaluate_model()` function applies KFold to the entire dataset without separating the test set first
   - Impact: This means the official MNIST test set isn't being used as described in the paper, potentially affecting reproducibility of the reported 99.012% accuracy

5. **Validation Metrics Reporting**
   - Paper: Table 1 shows validation accuracies for each fold with specific values (99.017%, 98.975%, etc.)
   - Code: While the code does calculate and print accuracies for each fold, it doesn't specifically format or save them to match the exact reporting structure in the paper
   - Impact: Makes it difficult to verify if running this code would produce the exact same fold-specific results reported in the paper

These discrepancies, particularly the input shape difference and cross-validation implementation, would likely prevent exact reproduction of the paper's reported results using the provided code.
