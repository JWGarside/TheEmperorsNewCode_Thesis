# Paper-Code Consistency Analysis

**Paper:** DeepCNN_JournalArticle
**Code:** MNIST_MA_03
**Analysis Date:** 2025-05-07

## Analysis Results

I've analyzed both the research paper "Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Handwritten Digit Recognition: A Cross-Validated Approach on the MNIST Dataset" and the provided Python implementation. While they share the same general approach, there are several notable discrepancies that could affect reproducibility.

## Discrepancies Between Paper and Code

### 1. Network Architecture
**Paper (Section II.B):** Describes a network with 32 filters in the first convolutional layer, followed by two consecutive layers with 64 filters each, and a fully connected hidden layer with 100 neurons.

**Code (define_model function):** Implements 32 filters in the first layer and two layers with 64 filters, but uses only 50 neurons in the fully connected layer instead of 100.

**Impact:** This difference in the number of neurons (50 vs 100) in the fully connected layer reduces the model's capacity, potentially affecting the final accuracy and learning dynamics.

### 2. Training Protocol
**Paper (Section II.C):** Specifies training for 10 epochs with a batch size of 32, using SGD with momentum 0.9 and learning rate 0.01.

**Code (evaluate_model function):** Matches these hyperparameters, but the paper doesn't mention whether verbose output was used during training.

**Impact:** Minimal impact on reproducibility.

### 3. Reported Accuracy
**Paper (Section III):** Reports a mean validation accuracy of 99.012% with a standard deviation of 0.028%.

**Code:** The actual accuracy achieved by this implementation might differ due to the architectural difference in the fully connected layer.

**Impact:** The reported performance metrics may not be reproducible with the provided code.

### 4. Figure Representation
**Paper (Figure 2):** Shows training and validation loss/accuracy curves with specific characteristics.

**Code (summarize_diagnostics function):** Produces similar plots but uses different colors (blue for training, orange for validation) than what appears in the paper's figure.

**Impact:** Minimal impact on reproducibility, but the visual representation differs.

### 5. Data Preprocessing
**Paper (Section II.A):** Describes normalizing pixel values from [0, 255] to [0, 1].

**Code (prep_pixels function):** Implements this normalization correctly.

**Impact:** No impact on reproducibility.

## Conclusion

The most significant discrepancy is the difference in the fully connected layer size (50 neurons in the code versus 100 neurons described in the paper), which could affect the model's capacity and performance. This architectural difference means that the exact performance metrics reported in the paper (99.012% accuracy) may not be reproducible with the provided code implementation. Researchers attempting to replicate the study should be aware of this difference and adjust the model architecture accordingly.
