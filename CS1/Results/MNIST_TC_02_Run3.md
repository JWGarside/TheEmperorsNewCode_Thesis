# Paper-Code Consistency Analysis

**Paper:** DeepCNN_JournalArticle
**Code:** MNIST_TC_02

## Analysis Results

I've analyzed both the research paper "Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Handwritten Digit Recognition: A Cross-Validated Approach on the MNIST Dataset" and the provided Python code implementation. Here are the discrepancies I found between them:

## Discrepancies Between Paper and Code

1. **Optimizer Choice**
   - **Paper (Section II.C)**: "We select the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with momentum (0.9)" and "We set the learning rate to 0.01"
   - **Code (Line 45-46)**: Uses Adam optimizer with learning rate 0.001
   ```python
   opt = Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
   ```
   - **Impact**: This is a significant discrepancy that would affect reproducibility. Different optimizers with different learning rates can lead to substantially different convergence patterns and final model performance.

2. **Number of Epochs**
   - **Paper (Section II.C)**: "Each fold iteration trains for 10 epochs with a batch size of 32"
   - **Code (Line 58)**: Matches the paper with 10 epochs and batch size of 32
   - **Impact**: No discrepancy in this aspect.

3. **Model Architecture**
   - **Paper (Section II.B and Fig. 1)**: Describes a model with initial 32 filters, followed by max pooling, then two consecutive convolutional layers with 64 filters each, followed by another max pooling layer
   - **Code (Lines 36-43)**: Matches this architecture
   - **Impact**: No discrepancy in this aspect.

4. **Cross-Validation Implementation**
   - **Paper (Section II.C)**: Describes using the original 60,000 MNIST training examples divided into 5 folds
   - **Code (Lines 52-53)**: Uses KFold from sklearn with n_folds=5 and random_state=1
   ```python
   kfold = KFold(n_folds, shuffle=True, random_state=1)
   ```
   - **Impact**: The code implementation uses random shuffling with a fixed seed, which isn't explicitly mentioned in the paper but is a reasonable implementation choice.

5. **Performance Metrics**
   - **Paper (Table 1)**: Reports validation accuracies for each fold with a mean of 99.012%
   - **Code (Lines 60-63)**: Calculates and prints accuracy for each fold but doesn't explicitly format it as in the paper's table
   - **Impact**: The code collects the same metrics but presents them differently.

## Most Significant Discrepancy

The most critical discrepancy is the optimizer choice. The paper explicitly states using SGD with momentum 0.9 and learning rate 0.01, while the code uses Adam with learning rate 0.001. This difference would likely result in different training dynamics and potentially different final performance metrics, making exact reproduction of the paper's results impossible with the provided code.

This discrepancy would need to be resolved for proper reproducibility of the research findings.
