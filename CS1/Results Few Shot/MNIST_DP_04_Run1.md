## Analysis Results

After carefully comparing the research paper and the provided code implementation, I've identified several discrepancies that could affect reproducibility:

1. Image Flipping in Preprocessing
   Paper Section: No mention of image flipping in Section II.A (Dataset Preparation)
   Code Location: `load_dataset()` function contains `trainX = np.flip(trainX, axis=1)` and `testX = np.flip(testX, axis=1)`
   Affects Results? Yes
   Explanation: The code horizontally flips all MNIST images, which is not mentioned in the paper. This transformation would significantly alter the appearance of digits (e.g., making "3" appear mirrored), potentially affecting model performance and making results non-reproducible.

2. Architecture Discrepancy
   Paper Section: Section II.B describes "two consecutive convolutional layers" in the second block
   Code Location: `define_model()` function shows three convolutional layers total (one in first block, two in second)
   Affects Results? No
   Explanation: The code implementation matches the paper's description of the architecture, with one convolutional layer in the first block and two in the second block.

3. Training Epochs
   Paper Section: Section II.C states "Each fold iteration trains for 10 epochs"
   Code Location: `evaluate_model()` function uses `epochs=10`
   Affects Results? No
   Explanation: The code correctly implements 10 epochs as specified in the paper.

4. Learning Rate and Momentum
   Paper Section: Section II.C mentions "learning rate to 0.01" and "momentum (0.9)"
   Code Location: `define_model()` function uses `SGD(learning_rate=0.01, momentum=0.9)`
   Affects Results? No
   Explanation: The code correctly implements the optimizer parameters as specified in the paper.

The horizontal flipping of images is a significant discrepancy that would affect reproducibility and potentially the validity of the results, as this transformation is not mentioned anywhere in the paper's methodology section and would substantially alter the input data characteristics.
