# Paper-Code Consistency Analysis

**Paper:** DeepCNN_JournalArticle
**Code:** MNIST_EE_02
**Analysis Date:** 2025-05-08

## Analysis Results

I've carefully compared the research paper "Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Handwritten Digit Recognition: A Cross-Validated Approach on the MNIST Dataset" with the provided code implementation. Here are my findings:

## Discrepancy 1: Evaluation Metric
**Paper Claim:** "We monitor both validation accuracy and complete training history to assess model fit and generalization capabilities" (Section II.C)
**Code Section:** `model.compile(optimizer=opt, loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['Precision'])`
**Affects Results?** Yes
**Explanation:** The paper discusses using accuracy as the evaluation metric throughout (including Table 1 showing "Validation Accuracy"), but the code uses precision instead. This would lead to different reported performance metrics and could affect model selection decisions.

## Discrepancy 2: Model Architecture
**Paper Claim:** "The second convolutional block implements a deeper feature hierarchy with two consecutive convolutional layers, each utilizing 64 filters of size 3Ã—3" (Section II.B)
**Code Section:** 
```python
model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', kernel_initializer='he_uniform', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)))
model.add(MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', kernel_initializer='he_uniform'))
model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', kernel_initializer='he_uniform'))
model.add(MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
```
**Affects Results?** No
**Explanation:** The code implementation matches the paper's described architecture with 32 filters in the first layer and two consecutive 64-filter layers in the second block.

## Discrepancy 3: Performance Reporting
**Paper Claim:** "The mean validation accuracy across all folds is 99.012%, with a standard deviation of 0.028%" (Section III)
**Code Section:** 
```python
print('> %.3f' % (acc * 100.0))
print('Accuracy: mean=%.3f std=%.3f, n=%d' % (mean(scores)*100, std(scores)*100, len(scores)))
```
**Affects Results?** No
**Explanation:** While the code will report precision instead of accuracy due to Discrepancy 1, the reporting format itself is consistent with the paper's approach.

## Discrepancy 4: Plotting Function
**Paper Claim:** Figure 2 shows "Cross Entropy Loss and Classification Accuracy across epochs for each fold"
**Code Section:**
```python
def summarize_diagnostics(histories):
    for i in range(len(histories)):
        # plot loss
        plt.subplot(2, 1, 1)
        plt.title('Cross Entropy Loss')
        plt.plot(histories[i].history['loss'], color='blue', label='train')
        plt.plot(histories[i].history['val_loss'], color='orange', label='test')
        # plot accuracy
        plt.subplot(2, 1, 2)
        plt.title('Classification Accuracy')
        plt.plot(histories[i].history['accuracy'], color='blue', label='train')
        plt.plot(histories[i].history['val_accuracy'], color='orange', label='test')
    plt.show()
```
**Affects Results?** Yes
**Explanation:** The code plots training and validation metrics for each fold separately, but the paper's Figure 2 shows combined results with different colors for each fold. This visualization difference could lead to different interpretations of model performance across folds.

## Conclusion
The primary issue that would affect reproducibility is the use of precision instead of accuracy as the evaluation metric. This would lead to different reported performance values compared to those stated in the paper. The visualization approach also differs, which could impact interpretation. The core model architecture and methodology appear consistent between the paper and code.
