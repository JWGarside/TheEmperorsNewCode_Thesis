# Paper-Code Consistency Analysis

**Paper:** DeepCNN_JournalArticle
**Code:** MNIST_IE_02
**Analysis Date:** 2025-05-08

## Analysis Results

After carefully comparing the research paper and the provided code implementation, I've identified the following discrepancies:

1. Model Architecture Discrepancy
   Paper Section: Section II.B describes "two consecutive convolutional layers, each utilizing 64 filters of size 3Ã—3" in the second convolutional block.
   Code Section: `define_model()` function implements this correctly with two Conv2D(64, (3, 3)) layers.
   Affects Results? No
   Explanation: The code correctly implements the architecture as described in the paper.

2. Learning Rate Value
   Paper Section: Section II.C states "We set the learning rate to 0.01"
   Code Section: `opt = SGD(learning_rate=0.01, momentum=0.9)`
   Affects Results? No
   Explanation: The learning rate in the code matches what's specified in the paper.

3. Cross-Validation Implementation
   Paper Section: Section II.C describes a 5-fold cross-validation strategy
   Code Section: `evaluate_model()` function implements KFold with n_folds=5
   Affects Results? No
   Explanation: The code correctly implements the 5-fold cross-validation as described.

4. Batch Size
   Paper Section: Section II.C mentions "batch size of 32"
   Code Section: `model.fit(trainX, trainY, epochs=10, batch_size=32...)`
   Affects Results? No
   Explanation: The batch size in the code matches what's specified in the paper.

5. Number of Epochs
   Paper Section: Section II.C mentions training for 10 epochs
   Code Section: `model.fit(trainX, trainY, epochs=10...)`
   Affects Results? No
   Explanation: The number of epochs in the code matches what's specified in the paper.

NO MAJOR DISCREPANCIES FOUND

The provided code is a faithful implementation of the methodology described in the research paper. The CNN architecture, hyperparameters, training procedure, and evaluation approach all align with what's described in the paper. The implementation should produce results consistent with those reported in the paper, achieving approximately 99.012% accuracy with minimal variance across folds.
