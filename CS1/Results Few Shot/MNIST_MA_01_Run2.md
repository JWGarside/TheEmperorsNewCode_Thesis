# Paper-Code Consistency Analysis

**Paper:** DeepCNN_JournalArticle
**Code:** MNIST_MA_01

## Analysis Results

I've carefully compared the research paper "Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Handwritten Digit Recognition: A Cross-Validated Approach on the MNIST Dataset" with the provided Python code implementation. Here are my findings:

## Discrepancy 1: CNN Architecture
**Paper Section**: Section II.B describes the model architecture with "32 filters of size 3×3" in the initial convolutional layer, followed by two consecutive layers of "64 filters of size 3×3".
**Code Section**: The `define_model()` function implements 64 filters of size 5×5 in the first layer, followed by two layers with 64 filters of size 3×3.
**Affects Results?**: Yes
**Explanation**: The filter size difference (5×5 vs 3×3) in the first layer and filter count difference (64 vs 32) will significantly affect feature extraction characteristics, potentially changing model performance and convergence behavior.

## Discrepancy 2: Validation Approach
**Paper Section**: Section II.C states "For each of the five experimental iterations, we train on 48,000 examples (four folds) while validating on the remaining 12,000 examples (one fold)."
**Code Section**: The code uses KFold from scikit-learn which splits the entire training set into training and validation portions, but doesn't explicitly ensure the 48,000/12,000 split described.
**Affects Results?**: No
**Explanation**: While the implementation details differ slightly, the k-fold cross-validation with k=5 will produce the same 80%/20% split ratio (48,000/12,000) as described in the paper.

## Discrepancy 3: Reported Accuracy
**Paper Section**: Section III reports a mean validation accuracy of 99.012% with a standard deviation of 0.028%.
**Code Section**: The code calculates and reports accuracy but doesn't enforce specific values.
**Affects Results?**: No
**Explanation**: This is an expected outcome discrepancy rather than an implementation issue. The different architecture in the code would naturally lead to different performance metrics.

## Discrepancy 4: Epochs
**Paper Section**: Section III and Figure 2 show training and validation metrics over 10 epochs.
**Code Section**: The code uses `epochs=10` in the `model.fit()` call, which matches the paper.
**Affects Results?**: No
**Explanation**: The training duration is consistent between paper and code.

## CONCLUSION
The primary discrepancy that would affect reproducibility is the CNN architecture, specifically the first layer's filter size (5×5 vs 3×3) and filter count (64 vs 32). This difference would likely lead to different feature extraction patterns and could significantly impact model performance and training dynamics. The other differences are minor and unlikely to substantially affect the reproducibility of the work.
