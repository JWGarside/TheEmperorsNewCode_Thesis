# Paper-Code Consistency Analysis

**Paper:** DeepCNN_JournalArticle
**Code:** MNIST_DP_01
**Analysis Date:** 2025-05-08

## Analysis Results

After comparing the research paper and the provided code implementation, I've identified the following discrepancies:

## 1. Normalization Inconsistency
**Paper Section**: Section II.A states "We normalize pixel intensities from their original range [0, 255] to [0, 1] by dividing by 255.0"
**Code Location**: In `prep_pixels()` function:
```python
train_norm = train_norm / 255.0*2
test_norm = test_norm / 255.0
```
**Affects Results?**: Yes
**Explanation**: The training data is normalized to [0, 2] range while test data is normalized to [0, 1] range. This inconsistency between training and testing normalization would significantly impact model performance and reproducibility, as the network would be trained on one distribution but tested on another.

## 2. Model Architecture Discrepancy
**Paper Section**: Section II.B describes "two consecutive convolutional layers, each utilizing 64 filters of size 3Ã—3" in the second convolutional block
**Code Location**: In `define_model()` function:
```python
model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', kernel_initializer='he_uniform'))
model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', kernel_initializer='he_uniform'))
```
**Affects Results?**: No
**Explanation**: The code correctly implements the architecture as described in the paper.

## 3. Cross-Validation Implementation
**Paper Section**: Section II.C mentions "k-fold cross-validation strategy with k=5"
**Code Location**: In `evaluate_model()` function:
```python
def evaluate_model(dataX, dataY, n_folds=5):
    # ...
    kfold = KFold(n_folds, shuffle=True, random_state=1)
```
**Affects Results?**: No
**Explanation**: The code correctly implements 5-fold cross-validation as described in the paper.

## 4. Optimizer Configuration
**Paper Section**: Section II.C mentions "learning rate to 0.01"
**Code Location**: In `define_model()` function:
```python
opt = SGD(learning_rate=0.01, momentum=0.9)
```
**Affects Results?**: No
**Explanation**: The code correctly implements the optimizer with the learning rate specified in the paper.

The normalization discrepancy between training and test data is a significant issue that would affect reproducibility and model performance. This inconsistency would cause the model to be trained on data with a different distribution than what it's evaluated on, leading to unreliable results that don't match the paper's reported 99.012% accuracy.
